Examples:

 TODO

To see all options:

 % parse-nop-pbb --help

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Indonesian property tax object number, or Nomor Objek Pajak Pajak Bumi dan
Bangunan, is a number given to a tax object (a piece of land with its
house/building).

NOP PBB is composed of 18 digits as follow:

 AA.BB.CCC.DDD.EEE-XXXX.Y

AA is the province code from BPS. BB is locality (city/regency a.k.a
kota/kabupaten) code from BPS. CCC is district (kecamatan) code from BPS. DDD is
village (desa/kelurahan) code from BPS. EEE is block code. XXXX is the object
number. Y is a special code (it is most likely not a check digit, since it is
almost always has the value of 0).

The function will return status 200 if syntax is valid and return the parsed
information hash. Otherwise it will return 400.

Currently the length and AA code is checked against valid province code. There
is currently no way to check whether a specific NOP PBB actually exists, because
you would need to query Dirjen Pajak's database for that.
